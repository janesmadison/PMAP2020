# Getting Started

The project was created by Madison Janes, Tavarius Fleming, and Faith Hough.

## Description

The backend is a PHP RESTful backend which accepts POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT
requests from frontend services. The project's intention is to be a clean
and user friendly survey service, allowing administrators to send out surveys
to student users. The database is written in MySQL.

The database tables to get set up are in pmap_database.sql located in database folder.

## Installation

## NPM


## Frontend

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
