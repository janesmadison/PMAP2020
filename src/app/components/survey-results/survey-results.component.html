<!-- This component currently displays a drop down button that is supposed to show all of the students in all of the classes that the user thats signed in is currently the
administrator of. After a students name has been selected Their email should be sent to the results service, then sent to get results. This does not currently work with the backend.
Because getRoster returns all of the information from the Users table in the database we would have liked to create multiple drop down buttons to let the user select a class, group,
and then student -->
<h1>
  Survey Results

<!-- use getRoster to retrieve the students information -->
<!-- Using *ngFor allows the button to add options on the fly from "students" which is an array of classRoster(contained in common.types) -->
<div class="form-group">
  <label>Select the student you would like to see results for: </label>
