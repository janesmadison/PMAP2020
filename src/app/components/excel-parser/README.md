# As an admin how to format the excel file for correct parsing

1. Using the teachers blackboard page for a specific class the administrators copy and paste the class
   roster into the excel spreadsheet.

2. Once the excel spreadsheet is filled you must remove the header row from the excel file

3. Next, the administration must add the group that the student is in the trailing column
   next to the students names

Once the following steps are complete the excel file is ready for parsing!!!
