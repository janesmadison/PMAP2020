# BACKEND

This backend was created using PHP on version 7.4.4.

The project was created by Madison Janes, Tavarius Fleming, and Faith Hough.

## Description

This backend is a PHP RESTful backend which accepts POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT
requests from frontend services. It then uses PHP's echo function to send http responses back to frontend.

## Development server

Run `ng build --prod` to generate the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. Then to run with PHP and database, we used XAMPP which required
the dist/ directory as well as the backend/ directory to be copied into XAMPP's htdocs/ directory.

## Testing

There is currently no testing being done on backend.
